#      delimited by triple dashes (i.e., ---).
#      Please judge whether two definitions have similar meanings or explaining a same noun word by performing the following actions:
#      1) Think the first question carefully: Are the meanings of these two definitions similar?
#      2) Think the second question carefully: Are the two definitions explaining a same noun?
#      3) If you answer "Yes" to one of the above questions, only output 1; Otherwise, only output 0.
