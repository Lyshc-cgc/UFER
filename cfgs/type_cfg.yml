      You are about to read two definitions (i.e., definition A and definition B), which are followed by examples and 
      delimited by triple dashes (i.e., ---). 
      Please judge whether two definitions have similar meanings or explaining a same noun word by performing the following actions: 
      1) Think the first question carefully: Are the meanings of these two definitions similar? 
      2) Think the second question carefully: Are the two definitions explaining a same noun?  
      3) If you answer "Yes" to one of the above questions, only output 1; Otherwise, only output 0.
